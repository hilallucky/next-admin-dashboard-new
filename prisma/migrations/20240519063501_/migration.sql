/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to alter the column `id` on the `User` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `VarChar(191)` to `Int`.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[uid]` on the table `User` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - The required column `uid` was added to the `User` table with a prisma-level default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty. Please add this column as optional, then populate it before making it required.
